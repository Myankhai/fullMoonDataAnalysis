# Moon Cycle Crime Analysis

This project analyzes the relationship between homicide frequencies in major US cities (Chicago and NYC), lunar cycles. The analysis combines crime data with astronomical events to explore potential correlations.

## Features
- Fetches and analyzes homicide data from Chicago and NYC
- Tracks full moon cycles and their correlation with crime rates
- Generates visualizations of correlations and patterns

## Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   NASA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. Run the main analysis:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Data Sources
- Chicago Data Portal
- NYC OpenData
- Astronomical calculations using ephem

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+

## Output
The analysis generates various visualizations and statistical analyses:
- Time series of homicide frequencies
- Full moon correlation analysis
- Combined analysis plots
